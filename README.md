# TNM093 InfoVis – Swedish Population Visualization

This mini-project for the course **TNM093 Information Visualization** explores data from all **290 Swedish municipalities**. The dataset contains several socio-economic attributes such as municipal tax rate, average taxable income, number of higher-education students, average age, housing (apartments in multi-dwelling buildings), migration (in-/out-moving), and total population.

Using **D3.js (Data-Driven Documents)**, the project presents the data through:

- **Table view** – an overview of each municipality’s values.
- **Scatter plot** – to study relationships between variables, especially between income and tax rate.
- **Parallel coordinates plot** – to compare many variables at once, with interactive brushing and draggable axes to highlight specific ranges and patterns.

The visualizations are used to investigate questions such as:

- How municipal tax rate relates to average income (we observe that municipalities with lower income tend to have higher tax rates).
- How many people move into vs. out of a municipality (the data suggests these values are often very similar, resulting in an almost linear relationship).

Overall, the project demonstrates how interactive visualizations can reveal patterns and differences between Swedish municipalities in a way that is clearer and more exploratory than raw tables or static charts.
